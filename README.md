![Gaming Industry Insights](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04f75fae-e811-4d58-b276-44598326d157)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a video game dataset to uncover insights related to sales performance, platforms, publishers, and release trends.  
The dashboard is built using **Microsoft Excel** with pivot tables, charts, and KPI cards.

The objective is to demonstrate **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills** relevant to a **Data Analyst role**.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- Game Title
- Console / Platform
- Publisher
- Developer / Company
- Global Sales
- Regional Sales
- Release Year
- Critic Score

This dataset contains information about Video Games from 1970-2024. It contains all the games released in the timeline by different genres, publishers, consoles, critics score, sales etc. **The dataset contained ~70% missing sales values. Instead of imputing blindly, I analyzed missingness patterns, separated reported vs unreported records, and derived insights from both revenue and non-revenue attributes. This ensured analytical integrity.**
